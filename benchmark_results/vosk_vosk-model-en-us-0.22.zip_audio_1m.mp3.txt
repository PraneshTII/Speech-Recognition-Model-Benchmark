what an audience but if i'm being honest i don't care what you think of my talk i don't care what the internet thinks of my talk
because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared and i think that's where most people get it wrong they are talking to you here instead of talking to you random person scrolling facebook
thanks for the click
you see back in two thousand and nine we all had these weird little things called attention spans yeah they're gone they're gone we killed them the debt i'm trying to think of the last time i watched an eighteen minute tedtalk it's been years literally years so if you're given a ted talk keep it quick i'm doing mine
under a minute i'm at forty four seconds right now that means we've got time for one final joke why are balloons so expensive
inflation
