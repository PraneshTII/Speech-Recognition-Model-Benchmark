[0.00s -> 6.32s]  There is a garbage truck of plastic, entering the ocean every minute,
[7.12s -> 11.52s]  and countless birds and animals are dying just from encountering plastic.
[12.72s -> 18.72s]  If you were to walk into a kitchen, sink overflowing, water spilling all over the floor,
[19.28s -> 23.44s]  soaking into the walls, you had to think fast. You're going to panic. What do you do first?
[24.64s -> 29.60s]  Why don't we turn off the tap? We are the world's largest chain of stores for the
[29.60s -> 36.32s]  ultra-poor, where everything in the store is available to be purchased using plastic garbage.
[36.32s -> 44.00s]  School tuition, medical insurance, Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power, or chain of stores in Haiti,
[44.00s -> 48.80s]  or more like community centers, where one of our collectors, Lisa Nasis, has the opportunity to
[48.80s -> 54.24s]  earn a living by collecting material from door to door, from the streets. And at the end of her
[54.24s -> 58.24s]  day, she gets to bring the material back to us, where we weigh it, we check it for quality,
[58.88s -> 66.88s]  and we transfer the value into her account. Lisa now has a steady, reliable source of income.
[66.88s -> 75.12s]  See, I see social plastic is the Bitcoin for the earth. And the app adds rewards, incentives,
[76.08s -> 85.60s]  group prizes, user rating with gamified recycling. We had fun and formality into an informal industry.
[86.32s -> 92.96s]  Now that plastic, we sell it to suppliers of great brands like Marks and Spencer's,
[92.96s -> 97.84s]  who are using social plastic directly into their manufacturing. We've closed the loop
[99.44s -> 108.48s]  in the circular economy. And so now, we can all be a part of the solution and not the pollution.
[108.48s -> 114.40s]  Okay, maybe cleaning the ocean's futile. It might be. But preventing ocean plastic
[114.40s -> 118.72s]  could be humanity's richest opportunity.
