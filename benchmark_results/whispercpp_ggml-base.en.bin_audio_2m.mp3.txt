 There is a garbage truck of plastic entering the ocean every minute.
 And countless birds and animals are dying just from encountering plastic.
 If you were to walk into a kitchen, sink overflowing, water spilling all over the floor, soaking
 into the walls, you had to think fast, you're going to panic.
 What do you do first?
 Why don't we turn off the tap?
 We are the world's largest chain of stores for the ultra-poor, where everything in the
 store is available to be purchased using plastic garbage.
 School tuition, medical insurance, Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power, or chain of stores in
 Haiti or more like community centers.
 We're one of our collectors, Lisa Nasees has the opportunity to earn a living by collecting
 material from door to door, from the streets, and at the end of her day she gets to bring
 the material back to us, where we weigh it, we check it for quality, and we transfer the
 value into her account.
 Lisa now has a steady, reliable source of income.
 See, I see social plastic is the Bitcoin for the earth.
 And the app adds rewards, incentives, group prizes, user rating with gamified recycling.
 We had fun and formality into an informal industry.
 Now, that plastic, we sell it to suppliers of great brands like Marks and Spencer's who
 are using social plastic directly into their manufacturing.
 We've closed the loop in the circular economy, and so now we can all be a part of the solution
 and not the pollution, okay, maybe cleaning the ocean's futile.
 It might be, but preventing ocean plastic could be humanity's richest opportunity.
