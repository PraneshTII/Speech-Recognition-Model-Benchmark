 There is a garbage truck of plastic entering the ocean every minute and countless birds and animals are dying just from encountering plastic.
 If you're to walk into a kitchen, sink overflowing, water spilling all over the floor, soaking into the walls, you have to think fast, you're going to panic.
 What do you do first? Why don't we turn off the tap?
 We are the world's largest chain of stores for the ultra-poor, where everything in the store is available to be purchased using plastic garbage.
 School tuition, medical insurance, Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power, or chain of stores in Haiti or more like community centers.
 Where one of our collectors, Lisa Neces, has the opportunity to earn a living by collecting material from door to door, from the streets.
 Now, at the end of our day, she gets to bring them material back to us, where we weigh it, we check it for quality, and we transfer the value into her account.
 Lisa now has a steady, reliable source of income. See, I see social plastic.
 Is the Bitcoin for the Earth, and the app adds rewards, incentives, root prizes,
 user rating, with gamified recycling. We had fun and formality into an informal industry. Now, that plastic,
 we sell it to suppliers of great brands like Marx and Spensors, who are using social plastic directly into their manufacturing,
 was closed the loop in the circular economy. And so now, we can all be a part of the solution
 and not the pollution. Okay, maybe cleaning oceans futile. It might be, but preventing ocean plastic
 could be humanity's richest opportunity.
