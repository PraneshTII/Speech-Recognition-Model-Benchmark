[0.00s -> 9.36s]  Bear is a garbage truck of plastic, entering the ocean, every minute, and countless birds and animals
[9.36s -> 14.00s]  are dying just from encountering plastic. If you were to walk into a kitchen,
[15.76s -> 20.80s]  sink overflowing, water spilling all over the floor, soaking into the walls,
[20.80s -> 25.84s]  you had to think fast. You're going to panic. What do you do first? Why don't we turn off the tap?
[26.80s -> 32.16s]  We are the world's largest chain of stores for the ultra-poor, where everything in the store
[32.16s -> 39.04s]  is available to be purchased using plastic garbage. School tuition, medical insurance,
[40.24s -> 45.52s]  Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power, or chain of stores in Haiti or more like community centers.
[45.52s -> 50.80s]  We're one of our collectors. Lisa Nasees has the opportunity to earn a living by collecting material
[50.80s -> 55.44s]  from door to door, from the streets, and at the end of her day she gets to bring the material
[55.44s -> 61.76s]  back to us, where we weigh it, we check it for quality, and we transfer the value into her account.
[61.76s -> 70.96s]  Lisa now has a steady, reliable source of income. CIC social plastic is the Bitcoin for the Earth,
[71.68s -> 81.20s]  in the app, ads rewards, incentives, group prizes, user rating, with gamified recycling.
[81.20s -> 90.64s]  We had fun and formality into an informal industry. Now that plastic, we sell it to suppliers of
[90.64s -> 95.84s]  great brands like Marks and Spencer's who are using social plastic directly into their manufacturing,
[96.56s -> 105.84s]  which closed the loop in the circular economy. And so now we can all be a part of the solution
[106.80s -> 113.84s]  and not the pollution. Okay, maybe cleaning the oceans futile. It might be, but preventing ocean
[113.84s -> 121.76s]  plastic could be humanity's richest opportunity.
