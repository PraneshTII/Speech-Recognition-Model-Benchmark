[0.00s -> 7.36s]  infinity in its simplest definition it simply means without limit it's not a
[7.36s -> 11.40s]  destination it's not a size we might have all first heard of no limit from
[11.40s -> 16.44s]  Master P in the 90s and there's no limit soldiers now the easiest examples of
[16.44s -> 20.00s]  infinity come from mathematics for example if I take the integers the
[20.00s -> 25.00s]  numbers one two three four I can continue on forever and it has no limit
[25.00s -> 30.60s]  but infinities have these crazy strange properties if you take the numbers
[30.60s -> 34.68s]  between the whole numbers take them for example the numbers between one and two
[34.68s -> 40.00s]  there are more of them than there are integers so not all infinities have the
[40.00s -> 45.84s]  same sizes and in physics we encounter these infinite sums take for example if I
[45.84s -> 51.64s]  add all the integers but I double the integer every time if I take one plus two
[51.64s -> 58.16s]  plus four plus eight plus sixteen and I continue to infinity and I add up all
[58.16s -> 64.40s]  those numbers guess what it equals it equals negative one believe it or not if
[64.40s -> 68.96s]  you stop before infinity you get a really big number but if you carried out to
[68.96s -> 74.92s]  infinity you get negative one now mathematical abstraction is one thing but
[74.92s -> 79.04s]  where does infinity manifest itself in the real world it's really difficult to
[79.04s -> 85.80s]  find for example some people believe that space is infinite we with our
[85.80s -> 90.08s]  instruments we can measure billions of light years and what we've just
[90.08s -> 95.44s]  discovered is that all of the universe that we can see out to her our horizon
[95.44s -> 99.88s]  because beyond that the light hasn't yet had time to reach us is only this
[99.88s -> 106.04s]  tiny region of all the universe that is but is it infinite in fact no one
[106.04s -> 111.04s]  really knows but the universe may be like the surface of a ball it has no end
[111.04s -> 116.48s]  but yet it's finite the universe may actually be like that now there's another
[116.48s -> 121.32s]  place in physics where we know that infinity actually does show up if you
[121.32s -> 126.76s]  take an elementary particle say like an electron as it travels through space it
[126.76s -> 131.64s]  can spontaneously become two photons two particles of light and each one of
[131.64s -> 136.48s]  these can spontaneously become a matter and antimatter particle and each one of
[136.48s -> 140.44s]  them can spontaneously become two photons and each one of them can
[140.44s -> 145.68s]  spontaneously become matter antimatter and you end up with this infinite sum of
[145.68s -> 151.24s]  possibilities and particles and photons and does that really exist yes it does
[151.24s -> 155.88s]  and the way we know is because when we do a calculation with quantum
[155.88s -> 159.96s]  electrodynamics and then we make a measurement and we compare the
[159.96s -> 164.48s]  prediction of the calculation with the measurement is one of the most accurate
[164.48s -> 169.32s]  predictions that science is actually able to make they agree to 15 decimal
[169.32s -> 172.84s]  places and I'll challenge you to attempt to measure anything the even
[172.84s -> 179.16s]  seven decimal places now mathematical abstraction is one thing the universe
[179.16s -> 183.88s]  is one thing and elementary particles is one thing but where do infinities
[183.88s -> 189.96s]  really impact our lives in the words of Deepak Chopra you and I are infinite
[189.96s -> 198.16s]  choice makers we live in a field of all possibility where at all moments where we
[198.16s -> 202.60s]  have access to infinite choices and I don't need to look any farther than my
[202.60s -> 208.20s]  own life to recognize that just like adding the ever doubling integers to get
[208.20s -> 211.72s]  bigger and bigger numbers actually ends up giving you a very small negative
[211.72s -> 216.04s]  number the sum of all the choices that we make in our lives even if many of
[216.04s -> 221.72s]  them are negative you can find that it sums to a very large positive value and
[221.72s -> 226.88s]  so for me that infinity is hope and that's the infinity that matters to me
[226.88s -> 229.88s]  thank you
