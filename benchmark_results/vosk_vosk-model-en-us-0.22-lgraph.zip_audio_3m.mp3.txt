the infinity in its simplest definition it simply means without limit is not a destination is not a size we might have all first sort of no limit from masterpiece in the nineties and is no limits soldiers now the easiest example of them infinity come from mathematics for example if i take the integers the know
labour's one two three four i can continue on forever and it has no limit but infinities have these crazy strange properties if you take the numbers between the whole numbers taken the for example the numbers between one and two there are more of them then there are integers so not all infinities have the same
sizes and in physics we encounter these infinite subs take for example if i add all the integers but i double the integer every time if i take one plus two plus four plus eight plus sixteen and i continue to infinity and i add up all those numbers guess what it equals
is it equals negative one believe it or not if you stop before infinity you get a really big number but if he carried out to infinity you get negative one now mathematical abstraction is one thing but where does infinity manifest itself in a real world is really difficult to find for example
well some people believe that space is infinite we with our instruments we can measure billions of light years and what we've just discovered is that all of the universe that we can see also how our horizon because beyond that the light hasn't yet had time to reach us is only this tiny room
region of all the universe that is but is an infinite in fact no one really knows but the universe may be like the surface of a ball it has no end but yet is finite the universe may actually be like that now there is another place in physics where we know that infinity actually does show up
if you take an elementary particle say like an electron as it travels through space it can spontaneously become two photons to particles of light and each one of these can spontaneously become a matter and anti-matter particle and each one of them can spontaneously become two photons in each one of them can spontaneously
the become matter anti matter and you end up with this infinite some of possibilities and particles and photons and does that really exist yes it does and away we know is because when we do a calculation with quantum electrodynamics and we make a measurement and we compare the prediction
of the calculation with the measurement is one of the most accurate predictions that science is actually able to make they agree to fifteen decimal places and our challenge you to attempt the measure anything even seven decimal places now mathematical abstraction is one thing the universe is one thing and elementary
particles is one thing but where to infinity is really impact our lives in a words of deepak chopra you and i are infinite choice makers we live in a field of all possibility where at all moments where we have access to infinite choices and i don't need to look
eighty bar than my own life to recognize that just like adding the ever doubling integers to get bigger and bigger numbers actually ends up giving you a very small a negative number the sum of all the choices that we make in our lives even if many of them are negative you can find that it thumbs to a very large positive value
and so for me that infinity is hope a nasty infinity that matters to me thank you
huh
