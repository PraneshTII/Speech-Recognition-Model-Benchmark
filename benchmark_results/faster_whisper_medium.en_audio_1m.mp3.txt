[0.00s -> 2.94s]  Wow, what an audience.
[2.94s -> 6.56s]  But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.
[6.56s -> 7.56s]  I don't.
[7.56s -> 9.52s]  I care what the internet thinks of my talk.
[9.52s -> 12.98s]  Because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared.
[12.98s -> 14.90s]  And I think that's where most people get it wrong.
[14.90s -> 23.00s]  They're talking to you here instead of talking to you, random person scrolling Facebook.
[23.00s -> 24.72s]  Thanks for the click.
[24.72s -> 30.16s]  You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird little things called attention spans.
[30.16s -> 31.80s]  Yeah, they're gone.
[31.80s -> 32.80s]  They're gone.
[32.80s -> 33.80s]  We killed them.
[33.80s -> 34.80s]  They're dead.
[34.80s -> 38.64s]  I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED Talk.
[38.64s -> 41.40s]  It's been years, literally years.
[41.40s -> 44.16s]  So if you're giving a TED Talk, keep it quick.
[44.16s -> 46.04s]  I'm doing mine in under a minute.
[46.04s -> 47.66s]  I'm at 44 seconds right now.
[47.66s -> 50.00s]  That means we've got time for one final joke.
[50.00s -> 53.32s]  Why are balloons so expensive?
[53.32s -> 55.12s]  Inflation.
