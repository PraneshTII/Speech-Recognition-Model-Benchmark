thanks for the click
see back in two thousand and nine we all have these weird little things called attention spans yeah they're gone they're gone we killed them the their debt i'm trying to think of the last time i watched an eighteen minute tedtalk it's been years literally years so if you're given a ted talk keep it quick i'm doing mine
under a minute
i'm at forty four seconds right now that means we got time for one final joke why are balloons so expensive
inflation
