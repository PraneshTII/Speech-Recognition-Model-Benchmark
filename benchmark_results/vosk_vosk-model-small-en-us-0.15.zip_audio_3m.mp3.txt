infinity
it has simple as definition it simply means without limit it's not a destination is not a size we might have all first heard of no limit from mass to pee in the nineties and is no limit soldiers now the easiest example of them infinity come from mathematics for example if i take the integers the numbers one two three four i can continue on forever
and it has no limit but infidelities have these crazy strange properties if you take the numbers between the whole numbers taken the for example numbers between one and two there are more of them then there are integers for not all and bit of these have the same sizes and in physics we encounter these infinite so
holmes take for example if i add all the integers but i double the integer every time if i take one plus two plus four plus eight plus sixteen and i continue to infinity and i add up all those numbers guess what it because it was negative one
believe it or not if you stop before infinity you get a really big number but if been carried out to infinity you get negative one now mathematical abstraction is one thing but whether the infinity manifests itself in a real world is really difficult to climb for example some people believe that space
his infinite we with our instruments we can measure billions of light years and what we've just discovered is that all of the universe that we can see also how our horizon because beyond that the light hasn't yet had time to reach us is only this tiny region of all the universe that is
but is an infinite in fact no one really knows but the universe may be like the surface of a ball it has no end but yet is finite the universe may actually be like that now there's another place and physics where we know that infinity actually does show up if you take an elementary particle say like going to elect
try as it travels through space they can spontaneously become two photons to particles of like and each one of these can spontaneously become a matter and anti matter particle and each one of them can spontaneously become two photos and each one of them can spontaneously com matter anti matter and you
end up with his input had some are possibilities and particles and photons and does that really exist
yes it does and away we know is because when we do a calculation we quantum electrodynamics and then we make a measurement and we compare the prediction of the calculation with the measurement is one of the most accurate predictions that science is actually able to make they agree to fifteen decimal places and ouch
l a judo chop the measure anything even seven decimal places
now mathematical abstraction is one thing the universe is one thing and elementary particles is one thing but why do infinity really impact our lives in a worth of deepak chopra
you and i are infinite choice makers we live in a field of all possibility where at all moments where we have access to infinite choices and i don't need to look eighty bar that the my own life to recognize that just like adding the ever doubling integers to get bigger
or a bigger numbers actually ends up give you a very small negative number the sum of all the choices that we make in our lives even have many of them are negative you can find that it thumbs to a very large positive value and so for me that infinity is hope a nasty infinity that matters to me
thank you
