    "transcription": " Infinity. In its simplest definition, it simply means without limit. It's not a destination,\n it's not a size. We might have all first heard of no limit from Master P in the 90s\n and there's no limit soldiers. Now, the easiest examples of infinity come from mathematics.\n For example, if I take the integers, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, I can continue on forever\n and it has no limit. But infinities have these crazy, strange properties. If you take the\n numbers between the whole numbers, take them, for example, the numbers between 1 and 2.\n There are more of them than there are integers. So not all infinities have the same sizes.\n And in physics, we encounter these infinite sums. Take, for example, if I add all the\n integers, but I double the integer every time. If I take 1, plus 2, plus 4, plus 8, plus 16,\n and I continue to infinity and I add up all those numbers, guess what it equals? It equals\n negative 1. Believe it or not, if you stop before infinity, you get a really big number.\n But if you carried out 2 infinity, you get negative 1. Now, mathematical abstraction is\n one thing, but what does infinity manifest itself in a real world? It's really difficult to find.\n For example, some people believe that space is infinite. We, with our instruments, we can\n measure billions of light years. And what we've just discovered is that all of the universe\n that we can see out to our horizon, because beyond that, the light hasn't yet had time\n to reach us, is only this tiny region of all the universe that is. But is it infinite?\n In fact, no one really knows. But the universe may be like the surface of a ball. It has\n no end, but yet it's finite. The universe may actually be like that. Now, there's another\n place in physics where we know that infinity actually does show up. If you take an elementary\n particle, say like an electron, as it travels through space, it can spontaneously become\n two photons, two particles of light. And each one of these can spontaneously become a matter\n and antimatter particle. And each one of them can spontaneously become two photons. And each\n one of them can spontaneously become matter, antimatter. And you end up with this infinite\n sum of possibilities and particles and photons. And does that really exist? Yes, it does. And\n the way we know is because when we do a calculation with quantum electrodynamics, and then we make\n a measurement and we compare the prediction of the calculation with the measurement, it's\n one of the most accurate predictions that science is actually able to make. They agree\n to 15 decimal places. And I'll challenge you to attempt to measure anything to even seven\n decimal places. Now, mathematical abstraction is one thing. The universe is one thing. And\n elementary particles is one thing. But where do infinities really impact our lives? In\n the words of Deepauk Chopra, you and I are infinite choice makers. We live in a field\n of all possibility where at all moments where we have access to infinite choices. And I don't\n need to look any farther than my own life to recognize that just like adding the ever\n doubling integers to get bigger and bigger numbers actually ends up giving you a very\n small negative number. The sum of all the choices that we make in our lives, even if\n many of them are negative, you can find that it sums to a very large positive value. And\n so for me, that infinity is hope and that's the infinity that matters to me. Thank you.\n"

    "transcription": " Infinity. In its simplest definition, it simply means without limit. It's not a destination,\n it's not a size. We might have all first heard of no limit from Master P in the 90s and there's\n no limit soldiers. Now, the easiest examples of infinity come from mathematics. For example,\n if I take the integers, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, I can continue on forever and it has\n no limit. But infinities have these crazy, strange properties. If you take the numbers\n between the whole numbers, take, for example, the numbers between 1 and 2. There are more\n of them than there are integers. So not all infinities have the same sizes. And in physics,\n we encounter these infinite sums. Take, for example, if I add all the integers but I double\n the integer every time. If I take 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 and I continue to infinity\n and I add up all those numbers, guess what it equals? It equals negative 1. Believe it\n or not. If you stop before infinity, you get a really big number. But if you carried out\n to infinity, you get negative 1. Now, mathematical abstraction is one thing, but where does infinity\n manifest itself in the real world? It's really difficult to find. For example, some people\n believe that space is infinite. We, with our instruments, we can measure billions of light\n ears. And what we've just discovered is that all the universe that we can see out to our\n horizon, because beyond that, the light hasn't yet had time to reach us, is only this tiny\n region of all the universe that is. But is it infinite? In fact, no one really knows.\n But the universe may be like the surface of a ball. It has no end, but yet it's finite.\n The universe may actually be like that. Now, there's another place in physics where we\n know that infinity actually does show up. If you take an elementary particle, say like\n an electron, as it travels through space, it can spontaneously become two photons, two\n particles of light. And each one of these can spontaneously become a matter and antimatter\n particle. And each one of them can spontaneously become two photons. And each one of them can\n spontaneously become matter, antimatter. And you end up with this infinite sum of possibilities\n and particles and photons. And does that really exist? Yes, it does. And the way we\n know is because when we do a calculation with quantum electrodynamics, and then we make\n a measurement and we compare the prediction of the calculation with the measurement, it's\n one of the most accurate predictions that science is actually able to make. They agree\n to 15 decimal places. And I'll challenge you to attempt to measure anything to even seven\n decimal places. Now, mathematical abstraction is one thing. The universe is one thing. And\n elementary particles is one thing. But where do infinities really impact our lives? In\n the words of Deepauk Chopra, you and I are infinite choice makers. We live in a field\n of all possibility where at all moments we have access to infinite choices. And I don't\n need to look any farther than my own life to recognize that just like adding the ever\n doubling integers to get bigger and bigger numbers actually ends up giving you a very\n small negative number, the sum of all the choices that we make in our lives, even if\n many of them are negative, you can find that it sums to a very large positive value. And\n so for me, that infinity is hope. And that's the infinity that matters to me. Thank you.\n"

    "transcription": " Infinity. In its simplest definition, it simply means without limit. It's not a destination,  it's not a size. We might have all first heard of no limit from Master P in the 90s  and there's no limit soldiers. Now, the easiest examples of infinity come from mathematics.  For example, if I take the integers, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, I can continue on forever and it  has no limit. But, infinities have these crazy, strange properties. If you take the numbers  between the whole numbers, take, for example, the numbers between 1 and 2. There are more  of them than there are integers. So, not all infinities have the same sizes. And in physics,  we encounter these infinite sums. Take, for example, if I add all the integers, but I double  the integer every time. If I take 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 and I continue to infinity  and I add up all those numbers, guess what it equals? It equals negative 1. Believe it or  not. If you stop before infinity, you get a really big number. But if you carried out  2 infinity, you get negative 1. Now, mathematical abstraction is one thing, but where does infinity  manifest itself in a real world? It's really difficult to find. For example, some people  believe that space is infinite. We, with our instruments, we can measure billions of light  years. And what we've just discovered is that all the universe that we can see out to our  horizon, because beyond that, the light hasn't yet had time to reach us, is only this tiny  region of all the universe that is. But is it infinite? In fact, no one really knows.  But the universe may be like the surface of a ball. It has no end, but yet it's finite.  The universe may actually be like that. Now, there's another place in physics where we  know that infinity actually does show up. If you take an elementary particle, say like  an electron, as it travels through space, it can spontaneously become two photons, two particles  of light. And each one of these can spontaneously become a matter and antimatter particle. And  each one of them can spontaneously become two photons. And each one of them can spontaneously  become matter, antimatter. And you end up with this infinite sum of possibilities and particles  and photons. And does that really exist? Yes, it does. And the way we know is because when  we do a calculation with quantum electrodynamics, and then we make a measurement, and we compare  the prediction of the calculation with the measurement is one of the most accurate predictions  that science is actually able to make. They agree to 15 decimal places. And I'll challenge  you to attempt to measure anything to even seven decimal places. Now, mathematical abstraction  is one thing. The universe is one thing. And elementary particles is one thing. But where  do infinities really impact our lives? In the words of Deepauk Chopra, you and I are infinite  choice makers. We live in a field of all possibility where at all moments where we have  access to infinite choices. And I don't need to look any farther than my own life to recognize  that just like adding the ever doubling integers to get bigger and bigger numbers actually ends  up giving you a very small negative number. The sum of all the choices that we make in  our lives, even if many of them are negative, you can find that it sums to a very large  positive value. And so for me, that infinity is hope. And that's the infinity that matters  to me. Thank you.",

    "transcription": " Infinity, in its simplest definition, it simply means without limit.  It's not a destination, it's not a size.  We might have all first heard of no limit from Master P in the 90s and his no limit  soldiers.  Now, the easiest examples of infinity come from mathematics.  For example, if I take the integers, the numbers one, two, three, four, I can continue  on forever and it has no limit.  But infinities have these crazy, strange properties.  If you take the numbers between the whole numbers, take, for example, the numbers between one  and two, there are more of them than there are integers.  So not all infinities have the same sizes.  And in physics, we encounter these infinite sums.  Take for example, if I add all the integers, but I double the integer every time.  If I take one plus two plus four plus eight plus 16 and I continue to infinity  and I add up all those numbers, guess what it equals?  It equals negative one.  Believe it or not.  If you stop before infinity, you get a really big number.  But if you carried out to infinity, you get negative one.  Now, mathematical abstraction is one thing, but where does infinity manifest itself in  the real world?  It's really difficult to find.  For example, some people believe that space is infinite.  We with our instruments, we can measure billions of light years.  And what we've just discovered is that all of the universe that we can see out to our  horizon, because beyond that, the light hasn't yet had time to reach us, is only  this tiny region of all the universe that is.  But is it infinite?  In fact, no one really knows.  But the universe may be like the surface of a ball.  It has no end, but yet it's finite.  The universe may actually be like that.  Now, there's another place in physics where we know that infinity actually does show up.  If you take an elementary particle, say like an electron, as it travels through space,  it can spontaneously become two photons, two particles of light.  And each one of these can spontaneously become a matter and antimatter particle.  And each one of them can spontaneously become two photons.  And each one of them can spontaneously become matter, antimatter.  And you end up with this infinite sum of possibilities and particles and photons.  And does that really exist?  Yes, it does.  And the way we know is because when we do a calculation with quantum electrodynamics,  and then we make a measurement, and we compare the prediction of the calculation with the  measurement, it's one of the most accurate predictions that science is actually able  to make.  They agree to 15 decimal places.  And I'll challenge you to attempt to measure anything to even seven decimal places.  Now, mathematical abstraction is one thing, the universe is one thing, and elementary  particles is one thing, but where do infinities really impact our lives?  In the words of Deepak Chopra, you and I are infinite choice makers.  We live in a field of all possibility, where at all moments, we have access to infinite  choices.  And I don't need to look any farther than my own life to recognize that just like  adding the ever doubling integers to get bigger and bigger numbers actually ends up  giving you a very small negative number, the sum of all the choices that we make  in our lives, even if many of them are negative, you can find that it sums to a  very large positive value.  And so for me, that infinity is hope, and that's the infinity that matters to me.  Thank you.",

    "transcription": "the infinity in its simplest definition it simply means without limit is not a destination is not a size we might have all first sort of no limit from masterpiece in the nineties and is no limits soldiers now the easiest example of them infinity come from mathematics for example if i take the integers the know\nlabour's one two three four i can continue on forever and it has no limit but infinities have these crazy strange properties if you take the numbers between the whole numbers taken the for example the numbers between one and two there are more of them then there are integers so not all infinities have the same\nsizes and in physics we encounter these infinite subs take for example if i add all the integers but i double the integer every time if i take one plus two plus four plus eight plus sixteen and i continue to infinity and i add up all those numbers guess what it equals\nis it equals negative one believe it or not if you stop before infinity you get a really big number but if he carried out to infinity you get negative one now mathematical abstraction is one thing but where does infinity manifest itself in a real world is really difficult to find for example\nwell some people believe that space is infinite we with our instruments we can measure billions of light years and what we've just discovered is that all of the universe that we can see also how our horizon because beyond that the light hasn't yet had time to reach us is only this tiny room\nregion of all the universe that is but is an infinite in fact no one really knows but the universe may be like the surface of a ball it has no end but yet is finite the universe may actually be like that now there is another place in physics where we know that infinity actually does show up\nif you take an elementary particle say like an electron as it travels through space it can spontaneously become two photons to particles of light and each one of these can spontaneously become a matter and anti-matter particle and each one of them can spontaneously become two photons in each one of them can spontaneously\nthe become matter anti matter and you end up with this infinite some of possibilities and particles and photons and does that really exist yes it does and away we know is because when we do a calculation with quantum electrodynamics and we make a measurement and we compare the prediction\nof the calculation with the measurement is one of the most accurate predictions that science is actually able to make they agree to fifteen decimal places and our challenge you to attempt the measure anything even seven decimal places now mathematical abstraction is one thing the universe is one thing and elementary\nparticles is one thing but where to infinity is really impact our lives in a words of deepak chopra you and i are infinite choice makers we live in a field of all possibility where at all moments where we have access to infinite choices and i don't need to look\neighty bar than my own life to recognize that just like adding the ever doubling integers to get bigger and bigger numbers actually ends up giving you a very small a negative number the sum of all the choices that we make in our lives even if many of them are negative you can find that it thumbs to a very large positive value\nand so for me that infinity is hope a nasty infinity that matters to me thank you\nhuh\n"
